# InspectorLockButton
Adds a UI Toolkit template that can be used in custom inspectors to set elements in the inspector to locked, preventing them from being edited.

### Features
- Easily create lockable groups of elements using the UI Builder in Unity.
- Define different lockable groups within the same Inspector.
- Nested locked groups, giving you the ability to, for example, both be able to lock the entire inspector or just parts of it.
- A custom tool for setting up new lockable objects in your editor to avoid having to manually create each part.
